      # NOTES:
      # 1.) These values will need to be generated by Grafana and set in your
      #     Shell in order for the OTEL instance to talk to ship metrics to Grafana
      # 2.) I'm not sure why I can't use environment substition from OTEL for these variables.
      #     even though its mentioned in their docs you can. Since this repo is more focused
      #     on temporal than otel I'm using envsubst command from the makefile for these
